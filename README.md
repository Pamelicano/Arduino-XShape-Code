# Arduino-XShape-Code

This repository contains the Arduino code for a smart cooling system designed to regulate the temperature in urban areas. The system uses shadow panels to lower the cityâ€™s heat, collecting real-time environmental data such as temperature, humidity, and light intensity. The project aims to create an intelligent model for predicting and managing the city's microclimate, with features for fire and flood alerts. The code integrates with IoT sensors and is designed to help improve urban sustainability and mitigate heat island effects.
